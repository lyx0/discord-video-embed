# Discord Video Embedder

Lets you watch a discord video in the browser instead of downloading it by default.

Simply paste the link to a discord video at the end of the url(after the /, if there is none add one). 

Like this: https://dc.noury.ee/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/381520882608373761/989666371178754068/denkcats_1639474686233272.mp4

Run:
```
npm start
```

Or with pm2:
```
pm2 start "npm start" --name=dc
```
